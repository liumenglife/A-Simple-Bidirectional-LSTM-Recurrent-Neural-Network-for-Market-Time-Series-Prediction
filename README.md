# A-Simple-Bidirectional-LSTM-Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-Market-Time-Series-Prediction
The following is a recurrent bidirectional network model for predicting the trend of the closing values of a market over the next 8 hours. The Germany DAX dataset was used for the computation, composed by timesteps taken every 5 minutes for 20 years. The dataset was preprocessed to create timesteps with two consecutive market closing values and a binary label which indicates the trend of closing curve. The RNN was trained and tested with data generated batch-by-batch through Python generator method. The model was developed on Keras 2 with TensorFlow backend, in Python language v3.1.6 exploiting Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The code was developed and tested on Nvidia Titan X.
